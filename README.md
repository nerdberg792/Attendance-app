# Attendance Tracker App 
I have made this simple attandence tracker app as on my first projects ever . Ofcourse the UI is not something u can call sleek and contains a lot of bugs which I am trying to figure out . Collaborators are welcome . 


## Todos for this project (for future reference)
⋅⋅* Making the UI look better <br>
⋅⋅* Indentifying and fixing bugs <br>
⋅⋅* Switching to TS <br>
⋅⋅* Switching to a more efficient sql database <br>


## Frontend 
The frontend is basically written using React / vanilla JS / Tailwind for styling . I think material UI would have been a better choice and planning to switch to material UI . This web-app uses Cookies to store some Data 

## Backend 
The backend is written using in NodeJS using express framework and mongo/mongoose is use for the database . JWT is used for authentication .
